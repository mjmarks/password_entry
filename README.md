# Password Entry

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It is a simple React task in creating a password entry that addresses the following requirements:

1. Has two input fields to validate the entry from the user (both inputs must match)
2. Password has a min length of 6 characters
3. Pasword has at least 1 uppercase character
4. Password has at least 1 lowercase character
5. Password has at least 1 number
6. Password has at least 1 special character
7. Has a submit button that will trigger validation and present success or why the password entry failed

*Note: This project is not an indication of preferred implementations. Its goal is to satisfy the aforementioned requirements,
and nothing more.*
